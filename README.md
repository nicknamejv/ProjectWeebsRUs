# WeebsRUs

This is our application for a reverse engineered site.

# Objective
Our objective for this project is to create a full stack web application with the use of Express, Node.js, Mongoose, and MongoDB. With a partner we will reverse engineer a site of our choosing and pick our three key features to utilize within our own site. One of the main goals in this project is understand the user flow on the site we choose and create and implement our improvement. 

# User Story 
- Users will start from the website index/home page and videos will populate the page with popular animes.
- There are navgiation links around the site to help users traverse the application. They can click on genre to categorize the shows into respective sections in case they want to view videos on a specific genre. 
- When clicking on any video you will be taken to the show page for that given video. Users will be able to play/watch these videos as well as engage with other users by commenting below the video.
- There is a comment form and section for each video which users can engage with other users as well as react to the video they just watched.
- Users are also given the ability to create video recommendation right below the video. By doing so Users can push these recommended video into the websites home page for other incoming Users to see.
